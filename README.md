# Face Detection
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook which tests and compares 7 simple face detection Machine Learning algorithms.

The dataset used in these experiments consists of images of families collected from the web. Since most of these images are copyrighted, the dataset is going to remain private.

The face detectors used in these experiments are:
* **OpenCV Haar cascade Face Detector**
* **OpenCV DNN Face Detector**
* **HOG + Linear SVM Face Detector**
* **MMOD + CNN Face Detector**
* **MTCNN**
* **YOLOFace (YOLOv3)**
* **YOLOv5**

The detectors are evaluated based on
* **Total detection time**
* **Total number of faces detected**
